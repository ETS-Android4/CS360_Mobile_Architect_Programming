# CS360 Mobile Architect Programming
Apply mobile development principles and best practices to develop mobile applications using user-centered design principles and industry standards.

# Project 
Simplex Inventory App

# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The inventory application "Simplex" shall be used to track items in a warehouse. The app was designed for personal or commercial use for users to be able to track inventory of items.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The application required a screen for logging into the app, a screen with a grid that displays all items in the inventory, an item screen where a user can add, edit, or delete items, and a settings screen where a user can toggle SMS notifications on or off. A database with two tables was necessary, one to store the inventory items and one to store user logins and passwords.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
First, I spent some time researching successful inventory tracking apps to get a better idea of what they look like and how they feel. Next, I created an app development proposal where I was able to list requirements I wanted to incorporate in my app. In project two, I created the design elements of my app's UI (user interface). The final step was to add functionality to my designs. 

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I was able to ensure my code was functional by using the emulator that is built-in to Android Studio. This tool was very handy when it came to testing out the functionality of my app as I was quickly able to test the app.

# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Most of the process, from initial planning to finalization was challenging, but in a fun way as I enjoyed myself. I did run into a time problem towards the end of the project when adding functionality. I went above the required material in designing my app by including a bottom navigation menu and extra item attributes. When trying to make everything functional, I noticed I was burning a lot of hours and was quickly running out of time before the due date. I had to cut out some extra features from the app to be able to complete it on time.

# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I believe I did a great job for my skill level on the app as a hole. If I had to choose one component I was most proud of, it would be the design of the UI. I wanted to create a UI that is clean yet popped and is user friendly.
